- **Interactive Mode**: Select repositories when none specified
- **Environment Support**: Different commands for dev/prod environments
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling and recovery
- **Docker Compose Support**: Automatic detection and proper handling of containerized applications

### Docker Compose Support

Launchpad automatically detects Docker Compose applications and uses the appropriate commands:

- **Automatic Detection**: Looks for `docker-compose.yml`, `compose.yml`, and other common compose file names
- **NPM Script Detection**: Detects when npm scripts use Docker Compose commands (e.g., `"dev": "docker-compose up"`)
- **Smart Commands**: Uses `docker compose up` for dev/start, `docker compose stop` for graceful shutdown
- **Proper Cleanup**: The `down` command removes containers, networks, and optionally volumes
- **Container Logs**: Shows Docker container logs instead of process logs for compose applications

#### Docker Compose Commands

```bash
# Start Docker Compose services in development mode
launchpad app dev -r my-docker-app

# Stop Docker Compose services gracefully
launchpad app stop -r my-docker-app

# Stop and remove containers, networks (use for cleanup)
launchpad app down -r my-docker-app

# Stop and remove everything including volumes
launchpad app down -r my-docker-app --volumes

# View container logs
launchpad app logs -r my-docker-app --follow
```

#### NPM Scripts with Docker Compose

Launchpad also detects when your npm scripts use Docker Compose commands:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "docker-compose up --build",
    "start": "docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d",
    "test": "docker-compose run --rm app npm test"
  }
}
```

When you run `launchpad app dev`, it will:
1. Execute the npm script as usual
2. Detect that it uses Docker Compose
3. Track the Docker services that are started
4. Use proper Docker Compose commands when stopping (instead of just killing the npm process)

# 5. Verify everything is working
launchpad setup status
```

## CLI Development

If you're working on the Launchpad CLI itself, we've set up convenient commands to develop from the root directory:

### Quick Development Commands (from root)

```bash
# Run CLI directly from source (TypeScript) - fastest for development
pnpm cli --help
pnpm cli init
pnpm cli create project

# Development with watch mode (auto-restarts on file changes)
pnpm dev:cli

# Build only the CLI package
pnpm cli:build

# Run the built CLI (after building)
pnpm cli:built --help
```

### Development Workflow

1. **Make changes** to CLI source files in `apps/cli/src/`

2. **Test immediately** without building:
   ```bash
   pnpm cli --help
   pnpm cli init
   ```

3. **For watch mode development** (auto-restart on changes):
   ```bash
   pnpm dev:cli
   # This runs in watch mode - make changes and see them immediately
   ```

4. **Build and test the production version**:
   ```bash
   pnpm cli:build
   pnpm cli:built --help
   ```

### Available Development Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `pnpm cli [args]` | Run CLI from TypeScript source (fastest) |
| `pnpm dev:cli` | Watch mode - auto-restart on file changes |
| `pnpm cli:build` | Build only the CLI package |
| `pnpm cli:built [args]` | Run the built CLI binary |
| `pnpm cli:dev` | Alternative watch mode using CLI's dev script |

## Local Development

If you're working on the Launchpad CLI itself or want to run it locally for development purposes, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18.0.0
- pnpm >= 9.0.0

### Setup

1. **Clone and install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd launchpad
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Build the CLI:**
   ```bash
   # Build all packages (including the CLI)
   pnpm run build

   # Or build just the CLI
   cd apps/cli
   pnpm run build
   ```

### Running Locally

You have several options to run the CLI locally:

#### Option 1: Direct Node Execution
```bash
# From the CLI directory
cd apps/cli
node dist/bin/launchpad.js --help

# Or using the npm script
pnpm run start --help
```

#### Option 2: Global Link (Recommended for Development)
```bash
# From the CLI directory
cd apps/cli
pnpm link --global

# Now you can use 'launchpad' globally
launchpad --help
launchpad init
```

#### Option 3: Using pnpm exec
```bash
# From the root directory
pnpm exec --filter @loveholidays/launchpad-cli launchpad --help
```

### Development Workflow

1. **Watch mode for development:**
   ```bash
   # From the CLI directory - rebuilds on file changes
   cd apps/cli
   pnpm run dev
   ```

2. **Testing your changes:**
   ```bash
   # If you've linked globally, just run:
   launchpad --help

   # Or rebuild and test:
   pnpm run build
   node dist/bin/launchpad.js --help
   ```

3. **Code quality checks:**
   ```bash
   # Run linting
   pnpm run lint:biome
   pnpm run lint:oxlint

   # Format code
   pnpm run format:biome:write

   # Run all checks and fix issues
   pnpm run check:write
   ```

### Updating Your Local Installation

When you make changes to the CLI:

1. **Rebuild the CLI:**
   ```bash
   cd apps/cli
   pnpm run build
   ```

2. **If you're using global link, it updates automatically** - no need to re-link!

3. **If you installed globally via npm/pnpm install:**
   ```bash
   # Unlink the old version
   pnpm unlink --global @loveholidays/launchpad-cli

   # Rebuild and link the new version
   pnpm run build
   pnpm link --global
   ```

### Troubleshooting

- **Command not found after linking:** Make sure your global pnpm bin directory is in your PATH
- **Changes not reflected:** Ensure you've run `pnpm run build` after making changes
- **Permission errors:** You might need to use `sudo` for global operations on some systems

### Binary Configuration

The CLI is configured with the following binary setup in `apps/cli/package.json`:

```json
{
  "bin": {
    "launchpad": "dist/bin/launchpad.js"
  }
}
```

This means when installed globally, the `launchpad` command will execute the compiled JavaScript file at `dist/bin/launchpad.js`.

## Why Launchpad?

At LoveHolidays, we believe that great developer experiences lead to great products. Launchpad embodies this philosophy by:
